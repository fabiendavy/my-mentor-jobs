<h1>Teachers registration</h1>
We want to help families to find a teacher regarding their needs in term of fields and levels. This is what we do at MyMentor. The very first feature is the registration of teachers.
<h2>Specifications</h2>
We want to :
<ul>
  <li>Create new teachers. A teacher must include a unique id, firstname, lastname and a collection of Skills composed by a field associated with a level.</li>
  <li>Save teachers into data.json</li>
</ul>
<p>
  You have to use a reference to the Fields and Levels which are already stored in data.json
  We want to be able to execute a ruby file that will store new teachers in the data.json file.
