<h1>Educational matching</h1>
We want to help families to find a teacher regarding their needs in term of fields and levels. This is what we do at MyMentor. 
In the previous exercice you created and saved new teachers. Now we want you to save a client's request for private tuition. 
<h2>Specifications</h2>
We want to :
<ul>
  <li>
    Create and save a Request that includes the client's fullname, a reference to a level and to a field (stored in data.json).
  </li>
  <li>
    Search for teachers who match with a specific Request regarding its field and level. We have to return a collection of teachers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Update the request with the reference of one of the teachers who fits with the request. He is the teacher who has been selected by the client.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Feel free to improve the UX. We want to be able to execute a ruby file that will save the requests in data.json.
