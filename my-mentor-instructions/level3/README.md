<h1>Courses management</h1>
In the previous exercice you have created new teachers and chose one as private tutor for a specific client request. Now we would like to add a collection of new courses associated to a request and update a request with a price per hour.
<h2>Specifications</h2>
We want to :
<ul>
  <li>Update a Request with a price per hour</li>
  <li>Add a new course associated to a specific request that will include its length in hours and a date
  </li>
  <li>Compute the total price for all the courses of a specific request</li>
  <li><i>(optionnal)</i> Compute the total price of courses between two dates</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We want to be able to execute a file that will store the objects in the data.json file.
